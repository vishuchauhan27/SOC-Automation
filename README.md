# ‚öôÔ∏è SOC Automation

SOC Automation involves leveraging various tools and techniques to streamline security operations, enhance incident response times, and improve the overall effectiveness of security measures within an organization. This README provides an overview of SOC automation, its benefits, installation procedures for popular tools, and next steps for implementation.

## üìå Introduction
Automation in SOCs helps reduce manual effort, minimizes the risk of human error, and enables security teams to focus on more strategic tasks. With SOC automation, organizations can respond to incidents faster, analyze security events efficiently, and enhance compliance reporting.

## üíª System Requirements
- **RAM:** 16 GB or more (recommended)
- **Disk Space:** 100 GB or more (recommended)
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or other Linux distributions

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Installing TheHive
TheHive is a scalable incident response platform that allows security teams to collaborate and respond to incidents effectively. Follow the [TheHive Installation Guide](thehive_installation.md) for detailed instructions.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Wazuh
Wazuh is a security monitoring solution that provides real-time threat detection and compliance management. To install Wazuh, follow the steps outlined in the [Wazuh Installation Guide](wazuh_installation.md).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up SIEM Tools
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools aggregate and analyze security data from across the organization. Popular options include:
- **Elastic Stack**: For log management and analytics.
- **Splunk**: A powerful SIEM tool for data analysis and visualization.

You can follow the specific installation guides for each tool based on your preferences.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Once the tools are installed and configured, you can:
- **Monitor Security Events**: Use TheHive and Wazuh dashboards to monitor security events in real-time.
- **Automate Incident Response**: Configure playbooks in TheHive for automated incident response actions.
- **Analyze Logs**: Utilize SIEM tools to analyze logs and identify anomalies.

## üöÄ Next Steps
- **Integrate Tools**: Connect TheHive, Wazuh, and your SIEM tool for seamless data flow and incident management.
- **Create Playbooks**: Develop automation playbooks in TheHive for common security incidents.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Set up alerts and notifications for critical events to ensure proactive incident management.
